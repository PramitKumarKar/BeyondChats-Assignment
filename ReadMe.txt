Project Summary:
This project comprises of two principal components:
ChatList: 
This component is responsible for displaying the list of chats that the user has with other users. It also allows users to select a chat, which opens the message page for that conversation. It also contains a working search bar, which can be used by searching the name of the user name. I have used axios to fetch the API which provides me the list of chats.

It has an clear and detailed UI that displays the incoming and outgoing chats for a particular user, along with date and time it was sent.
